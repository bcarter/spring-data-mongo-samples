spring-data-mongo-samples
=========================
This project includes the single test case that I use to demonstrate
Spring Data Mongo in my Spring Data presentation.

The project is not intended to be built into a deployable JAR file,
but instead includes a test case that demonstrates Spring Data Mongo.
You may run this test case with 'mvn test' or import the project into
your IDE and run the test there.
